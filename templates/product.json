            "answer": "<p>Refined oils are typically extracted at high heat (up to 100 °C) using solvents, stripping flavour, aroma, and nutrients—and even creating trans-fats. True Harvest’s stone-pressed, cold-press process gently grinds seeds below 40 °C, preserving every antioxidant, vitamin, and natural fragrance for a pure, heart-healthy oil.</p>"

            "question": "Why is True Harvest’s wood-pressed oil more expensive?",
            "answer": "<p>We use traditional wooden Kolhu mills for a “first-press” stone-press process—crushing raw seeds only once, without solvents or bleaching. This slow, artisanal method locks in genuine flavour, aroma, and nutrients, making our oils more costly to produce but far richer in health benefits and taste.</p>"

            "question": "How does “cold-press” differ from “virgin” coconut oil?",
            "answer": "<p>Both virgin and cold-press methods avoid chemicals, but the feedstock differs: virgin coconut oil comes from fresh coconut milk, while our stone-pressed cold-press uses dried, flaked flesh for a slightly richer texture. Either way, you get unrefined, nutrient-dense oil ideal for cooking and skincare.</p>"
