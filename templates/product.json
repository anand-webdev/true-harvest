True Harvest goes further by using traditional stone-pressed mills, gently crushing fresh coconuts and sun-drying them under muslin cloth before bottling. This dual “cold-press” + “stone-press” process locks in MCTs, vitamins, and natural aroma—giving you pure, nutrient-rich oil ideal for cooking, skin care, and overall wellness.</p>"
